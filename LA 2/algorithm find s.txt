Initilize h to the most specific hypothesis in H (YES)
For each positive training instance x
  .For each attribute constraint i in h
          If the value i in h is satisfied by x then do nothing
          else replace i in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x i.e '?'
output hypothesis h
